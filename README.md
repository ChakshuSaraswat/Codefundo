//idea for codefundo++

-what are we planning to build?
we are planning to build an open source-deep learning-natural disaster-predicting
technology that will use swarm intelligence and community contributed sensor network data  

-how does it work?
phase 1:using sample data set of the weather conditions to predict 
relatively easier-to-predict natural disasters that have occurred in the
past as proof of concept and then to train our neural network to make
more accurate predictions
phase 2:gonna release our current developments to the open source community
where we will be able to improve the accuracy of our neural network
by collecting data from scientists,hobbyists, enthusiasts,major global companies 
and tech giants,researchers from simple diy senor networks continuously transmitting 
real time weather information
phase 3:storing and processing the data collected
phase 4:we are gonna use big data tools and also take help from the community 
in developing better algorithms with higher accuracy of predictions
of relatively easy to predict natural disasters
phase 5:improve the deep learning outcomes 
improve the scale of our sensor networks via open source contributions
move on to predicting the more harder to predict disasters
using swarm intelligence technologies eventually making it highly accurate
and self sustaining

-how users can get started with the project?
we will eventually release it to the open source community where 
 and the rest, so that they can create 
simple sensor networks in their locality/ neighborhood and share real time
weather and climate data to our database on the cloud
the open source community will benefit as they will get access
to vast amounts of real time weather data for research purposes 
and also, they will be able to use our existing framework ,
improve our prediction success rates and ultimately contribute to our 
noble cause this will improve both the users and the developers and 
will popularize and involve everyone

-what dataset(s) are you using?
sample dataset for proof of concept on a smaller scale
will eventually move to real time sensor data from our to be created 
vast open source community in the next phase of development

-what technologies are you using?
machine learning,large scale sensor networks,swarm intelligence,
neural networking,azure machine learning,big data processing tools,
real time data transmission technologies,cloud computing */
